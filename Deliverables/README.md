# DATA401-Project3

Data cleaning and generation of candidate feature sets is performed in the clean_data_and_feature_selection.ipynb file. 

The final feature set that is reflected in josiah_final_data.csv is created in feature_selection.ipynb

AIC Forward/Backward Stepwise Regression using the cleaned dataset is performed in the AIC_feature_selection.Rmd file.

Comparison of different feature sets using a linear regression model is performed in the linear_regression.ipynb file,
which also contains some model evaluation results.

The final model evaluation results can be found in mason_lr.ipynb. This uses a validation set and the results from this
file are used in the report. 

Implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and results of the Neural Network can be found in the neural_network.ipynb
